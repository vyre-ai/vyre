# launch: landing, install, onboarding, brand surfaces

(Named launch-surfaces.md because launch.md and LAUNCH.md are the same file on a case-insensitive disk.)

## Scope

- `site/` (vyre.run): index.html, styles.css, app.js, 404.html, og.png, favicon, `site/start/`.
- `scripts/install-box.sh` terminal experience (look only; flags, exit codes and `VYRE_NO_UP=1` unchanged).
- Look and copy of the onboard loopback pages (core/onboard). Logic stays with sessions.
- Brand surfaces and easter eggs listed below.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page vyre.run | launch | doing |
| /start page | launch | todo |

| og.png (1200x630) | launch | doing |
| GitHub social preview (1280x640, file only; the owner uploads it) | launch | doing |
| README hero image | launch (file), docs (README text) | doing |
| install.sh terminal output | launch | doing |
| Onboard loopback pages | launch (look/copy), sessions (logic) | doing |
| `vyre` no args, `vyre --version` banner | polish-cli | asked |
| `vyre up` ending | polish-cli | asked |
| Release notes header | docs | spec to hand over |
| Docs site header | docs | spec to hand over |
| Deck first run | pwa | spec to hand over |
| Phone first run | mobile | spec to hand over |
| Capsule first run | capsule-pro | spec to hand over |

## Easter eggs (for the lead's list; keep quiet publicly)

All off for --json, CI, NO_COLOR, non-TTY and prefers-reduced-motion. No network, no sound, never on real data.

Filled in as each lands.

## Done

## Doing

- Plan sent to the lead. Landing, install, onboard and assets in progress through subagents.

## Next

## Needs from others

- lead: which of Vyre IQ, Capsule auto-answer, voice, "do" computer use and the settings hub are in the RC. Until answered, anything not on main shows "coming".
- polish-cli: OK for `vyre high-five` and the rare fortune line (core/cli).
- sessions: pending onboard changes, if any.
- app-design: review of every visual.
- e2e: rc-smoke on the finished sha.

## Changed contracts

None yet.
