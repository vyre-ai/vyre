Branch: work/connectors · Worktree: ../vyre-connectors · ADR: 0016

## Scope

Owns `core/connectors/`, `core/mcp/`, `core/google/`, `core/cli/commands/connect.js`,
`deck/views/connections.js`. Small changes by contract in `core/gate/` (a module sender),
`core/harness/rules.js` (the hub's namespace), `harness/mcp/server.js` (aggregation) and
`deck/views/settings.js` (the Connections section).

- The MCP hub (`mcp`): many servers (stdio, streamable HTTP, SSE), credentials from the vault at
  call time, per-project and per-agent scope, lazy start and idle stop, outward tools held at the
  Gate.
- One MCP entry: the harness `vyre` server aggregates hub tools; `vyre mcp` runs it on stdio.
- Native Google (`google`): calendar and mail with OAuth or a DWD service account; sends and
  invites through the Gate; `google.find` for the Capsule.
- Deck Settings, Connections; `vyre connect add|list|remove|test`.

## Done

- The MCP hub: `core/mcp/hub.js` (the Hub class, injected deps), `core/mcp/index.js` (tools and
  callers), `core/mcp/module.json`. Tests: `core/mcp/hub.test.js` (12), `core/mcp/module.test.js`
  (5, real vyred). Idle cost is zero: no timer or child exists until a server is first used.
- One MCP entry: `harness/mcp/server.js` lists `mcp.tools` beside the module tools as
  `<server>__<tool>` (outward ones prefixed "(held for approval) ") and routes those names to
  `mcp.call` with the session key; a held call answers `{ held }` as text plus
  `structuredContent.held`. `capabilities.tools.listChanged` stays false (no notifications sent).
  Test: `test/harness.test.js` (fake stdio server in the hub).
- `vyre mcp` (imports the server, so its ppid is still claude) and `vyre mcp install [--yes]`;
  `vyre connect list|add|remove|test` in `core/cli/commands/connect.js`, with `--var VAR=value`
  added for plain stdio settings (the hub's `vars`). Test: `core/cli/commands/connect.test.js` (3).

- Read is disabled in Connections for a tool that sends (`mcp.test` marks it `sends`); the
  refusal says "set <tool> to write or off" (lead's decision: no migration, nothing shipped).
- Screenshots: headless Chromium on the test box, shared with pwa, at `CHROME=/usr/local/bin/vyre-chrome`
  (Playwright 1.55.0 build in /opt/ms-playwright, wrapper adds --no-sandbox for Ubuntu 24.04
  AppArmor). `node deck/test/connections-shots.js <out>` renders connections.png and the phone.
- perf-check on the test box 2026-09-27 (branch vs main, same host, load 4 to 8): RSS mean 102 MB branch
  vs 98 MB main, max under 144 MB both; steady-state CPU 0.00% on every sample after the first;
  no recurring timer under 60 s. The only idle timeout is computers' 60 s one. Both branch and main
  sometimes fail "sustained" at about 13% from a single ~64% FIRST sample (the tail of startup
  indexing caught by the idle window); main did it on 1 of 3 runs, the branch on 3 of 4. It is
  a perf-check boundary flake, not a standing cost; reported to the lead.

## Doing

- Nothing in flight.

## Next

- If the lead wants: make perf-check drop the first idle sample, or wait for CPU to settle
  before sampling (perf-check is not mine; needs its owner).

## Needs from others

- Lead: whoever owns scripts/perf-check, on the first-sample flake.

## Changed contracts

- `gate.request` accepts `agent` in its input from a module caller only (core/gate/index.js), so
  the MCP hub can file a held call under the agent vyred verified for it.
- `harness/mcp/server.js` refuses every request when `VYRE_HUB_CHILD` is set (3 lines).
- `core/harness/rules.js` rule 1 and `gate.route` step aside for `GATED`, an explicit list of Vyre
  module tools that hold at the Gate themselves: today only `google_mail_send` (under
  `mcp__vyre__` and `mcp__plugin_vyre_vyre__`).
