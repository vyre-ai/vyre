# ci

Branch: work/ci · Worktree: ../vyre-ci · Owner session: ci

Goal: build and test Vyre on GitHub Actions' free runners (public repo vyre-ai/vyre), so the Swift
Capsule, the iOS app and the Android app stop compiling on the user's Mac.

## Pre-publish scan (2026-09-27)

Scope: every commit on every branch of the live repo (44 branches, 834 commits), since teams will
push their work/* branches for Mac builds. Tools: gitleaks 8.28.0 plus a grep of `git log -p --all`
(content and commit messages) against a denylist of the user's names, clients, hosts, IPs and
paths. The denylist and the rewrite tooling live outside this repo, in the team folder under
`ci-rewrite/`, so the list itself is never published. Both ran on the test box, not the Mac.

### Secrets: clean

gitleaks reported 14 findings, all fixtures or code, none real:

- `local/capsule/lib/clips.test.js` (9): the secret-shape fixtures for the clipboard redactor
  (`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`, `ghp_abc...`, a stub OpenSSH armour, a jwt.io sample token).
- `core/push/push.test.js`: the RFC 8291 Web Push test vector.
- `core/vault/ssh/keys.js`: the OpenSSH armour regex, not a key.
- `core/computers/glass.test.js`: the RFC 6455 sample WebSocket nonce.
- `core/vault/import.test.js`, `core/vault/relay.test.js`: made-up vault values.

The grep for `sk-`, `sk-ant-`, `ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `xox*`, `AKIA`, private-key armour, JWTs,
`tskey-`, `AIza`, `whsec_`, Stripe live keys and `ya29.` found only the same fixtures. No `.env`,
`.pem`, `.key` or `.p12` file was ever committed. Every tailnet name and 100.x address is a
fixture; no real public IP appears.

### Private data: small, but real

1. **Commit identity.** Every commit carries the user's real name and personal address.
2. **A real client firm's name**, in one CHANGELOG line and one `docs/work/memory.md` line
   (commit 5dd4caa and the branches that carry it).
3. **The test box's private hostname and its vault file name**, about 60 lines across docs,
   CHANGELOG, `scripts/release.sh` and commit messages.
4. **Home-relative paths** to the private prototype folder (73) and to the team folder (3:
   `docs/work/capsule-pro.md`, `docs/work/capsule-now.md`, `scripts/capsule-spaces/run.js`).

Nothing else on the denylist appears. `/Users/` only ever shows sample homes (`/Users/alex`,
`/Users/a`); the only Gmail addresses are samples.

### The rewrite (all refs, in place, overnight)

Tooling in the team folder, `ci-rewrite/` (see its README): `preflight.sh` (every worktree clean
or WIP-committed, no detached worktree, no stash), `rewrite.sh` (`git filter-repo --force` on the
live repo with `--mailmap`, `--replace-text` and `--replace-message`, then a hard reset of each
worktree that preflight proved clean), `rescan.sh` (gitleaks plus the denylist over every ref;
must print CLEAN), `publish.sh` (create the public repo, push main and work/* only, re-running
rescan first), and `TEAMS.md`, the note for every team. Rehearsed on a full copy on the test box;
numbers below.

The same strings are scrubbed from main's tree in a normal commit on this branch first.

## GitHub (2026-09-27)

- `gh` is logged in as the user's account with scopes admin:org, repo, workflow.
- The org `vyre-ai` does not exist (404), and the name looks free. Orgs can't be created by API
  for a personal account: the user creates it at https://github.com/account/organizations/new
  (Free plan, name `vyre-ai`).

## Done
- Workflows: node, capsule-mac, ios, android (see CHANGELOG). ios/android use mobile's build
  commands (`apps/ios/scripts/build.sh test`, `gradlew -p apps/android`).
- 2026-09-27 published https://github.com/vyre-ai/vyre (public, default branch main):
  - main scrubbed and merged work/ci; teams frozen, open trees WIP-committed (tracked files only).
  - Mirror backup `<vyre-dir>/vyre-prerewrite.git` plus a bundle in the team folder's
    `ci-rewrite/backup/`. After publish there is no undo.
  - `git filter-repo --force` on the live repo, all 45 branches, 3-4 s; every worktree kept its
    uncommitted edits (mixed reset, then only rewrite-changed untouched files refreshed). A commit
    landed mid-freeze with the old hostname; a second pass caught it. Rescan CLEAN (900 commits).
  - Pushed private, verified the remote tips equal the scanned tips, flipped public. main and
    work/* only; vault/* and wip/* stay local. The pre-push guard is installed in the repo's hooks.
- A push of more than 3 refs creates no workflow runs, so main's first runs were dispatched by hand.

## Doing
- node on main d3ed622 (run 36278222482) is red on 5 code failures, not env: home.test.js:169,
  floor.test.js:150, rooms.test.js:217, and docs-check + docs-index (stale generated docs, env
  count 73 committed vs 72 made). They reproduce on testbox with Node 22. Sent to the integrator
  on 2026-09-27. capsule-mac, ios and android were green on main.
- Signing proof: run 36275719507 never proved anything. Its app step failed because work/ci-sign
  had no Sources/Extensions and build.sh's `find` aborts under `set -e` (capsule-pro has that
  dir now). The signing step then hung 40 min on `security add-trusted-cert`: in the user domain
  that call asks for a password. work/ci-sign 1a4931b merges work/capsule-pro and swaps only that
  step for `sudo security add-trusted-cert -d` (5 min step timeout). Run 36282004237 proved
  createIdentity on the runner: openssl, import and trust all exit 0, `{"ok":true}`, and
  find-identity lists 1 valid "Vyre Local". codesign then failed because Vyre.app did not
  compile: work/capsule-pro tip AgentDestinations.swift:47 `cannot find 'askItem' in scope`
  (capsule-pro's bug). ci-sign 0066ed2 signs a copy of vyre-launcher when the app is missing;
  its run is 36282086841 (in progress at logout).

## Next
- Check run 36282086841 (codesign lines at the end of the signing step), then send capsule-pro the signing lines. If it proves signing, delete
  work/ci-sign from origin (`git push origin --delete work/ci-sign`, no force needed).
- Recheck node on main after the integrator's fix: `gh run list -R vyre-ai/vyre --branch main --workflow node.yml`.
- Guard hooks: pre-push and commit-msg are in the shared hooks dir. On 2026-09-27 commit-msg
  rejected a private name and passed a clean message.

## Needs from others
- None.

## Changed contracts
- None.
